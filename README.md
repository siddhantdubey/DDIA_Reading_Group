## Book

[Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/).

## Why?

Some of this is taught in school but usually in isolation. A readthrough of it will give us an overview of the background knowledge required to design large scale software systems. A reading *group* is necessary because I need some accountability.
